This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Kotlin related to the `removeIf` function when used with `MutableList` and `MutableSet`.  The `removeIf` function, when used with a lambda that modifies the collection being iterated, produces unexpected results. This is because the iterator's internal state becomes inconsistent. The provided code examples highlight this behavior, demonstrating how using `removeIf` can lead to unexpected outputs when modifying the collection within the lambda expression. The solution provides a way to achieve the desired outcome without causing the unexpected behavior.
